# Design-Robot-feet
Design feet joints contain servo motor.<br>
defintions:
- **Servo motor** -> is a device that translates an electrical signal into precise mechanical motion. It typically consists of a motor, a position sensor, and a control circuit. Servo motors are widely used in applications requiring accurate control of position, speed, and acceleration, such as robotics, industrial automation, and remote-controlled systems.
- **SolidWorks** -> is a 3D CAD and CAE software used for designing and modeling products. It's essential in industries like engineering and manufacturing for creating detailed drawings and simulations.

First I searched on Google to see robots feet and how can they move. here the linkes I toke some inspitation from them:
[Humanoid Robot](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Based-Humanoid-Robot-Using-Servo-Motors/) and [Otto Robot](https://youtu.be/34v7R0FrSNE?si=N_Jk30fvBC9_bszg).  
Then I started sketching the first thing came to my mind ![photo_2024-07-07_22-23-02](https://github.com/RaghadAlmadani/Design-Robot-feet/assets/173769867/27bd62e9-b98d-47fe-a16d-1025ecddf5aa)
 then I start making the parts by using SolidWorks I draw six parts

 after that, I started to assumple them and adding servo motor in the joints ![Robot feet](https://github.com/RaghadAlmadani/Design-Robot-feet/assets/173769867/2a9f700c-ecec-423a-a50c-1e39d45b2013)
 the challenging parts in this task is to know how to make the robot stable,and making it moving the in right .
