# Design-Robot-feet
Design feet joints contain servo motor.
First I searched on Google to see robots feet and how can they move. here the linkes I toke some inspitation from them:
[Humanoid Robot](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Based-Humanoid-Robot-Using-Servo-Motors/) and [Otto Robot](https://youtu.be/34v7R0FrSNE?si=N_Jk30fvBC9_bszg).  
Then I started sketching the first thing came to my mind ![image]() then I start making the parts by using SolidWorks I draw 6 parts

 after that, I started to assumple them and adding servo motor in the joints ![Robot feet](https://github.com/RaghadAlmadani/Design-Robot-feet/assets/173769867/2a9f700c-ecec-423a-a50c-1e39d45b2013)
 the challenging part in this task is to know how to make the robot stable and miking it moving the in right.
